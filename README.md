# RothkoPaintingFCC

This project was made for me to get a better understanding of workflow.  It is a project called rothko painting from FCC (free code camp) and I modified it with the following features in mind:
- webpack
- webpack dev server
- style-loader
- css-loader
- postcss
- postcss-loader
- postcss-nested
- postcss-import
- postcss-simple-vars
- postcss-mixins
- html-webpack-plugin
- mini-css-extract-plugin
- css-minimizer-webpack-plugin

My aim was trying to implement mobile responsiveness, using concept of CSS modules, and BEM.  Although not perfect, I learned alot by building this project :)
